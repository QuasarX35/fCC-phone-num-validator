# US Phone Number Validator
This web application validates the format of a phone number against US phone number standards. It was created as a certification project for the FreeCodeCamp Javascript course. It can be accessed [here].

Important Note: This application only checks the format of the phone number and does not guarantee the number is actually callable or assigned.
